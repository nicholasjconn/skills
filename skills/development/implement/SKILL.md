# implement

Prerequisites: Requires named implementer, plan_reviewers, and code_reviewer targets. Delegated planning/review paths require dispatch-agent and the Agent Dispatch MCP dispatch_start/inspect/wait/output/continue/cancel contract; direct implementation does not dispatch. Project scratch uses .agent-layer/tmp as a convention. Missing dispatch capabilities must be reported; tracked skill content can advance independently of the installed CLI.

## Inputs

Require a task, request, or spec as `<input>` and dispatch targets named
`implementer`, `plan_reviewers`, and `code_reviewer`. Providing a target does
not imply its use. Do not infer missing targets. Use `/dispatch-agent` for every
dispatch.

## Decide Implementation Approach

Inspect the relevant architecture. Reuse existing code and established patterns
when they fit `<input>`. Resolve substantive requirements and tradeoffs before
implementation.

Planning and independent review add significant cost. Before implementation,
answer each question yes or no:

- Is a written plan required to confidently complete and verify `<input>`?
- If a plan is required, does its material risk or complexity justify
  independent plan review?
- Does the implementation's material risk or complexity justify independent
  code review, whether implementation is direct or planned?

If no plan is required, implement `<input>` directly without dispatching or
writing a plan. Run only targeted checks as needed. Check completion against
`<input>`, resolve gaps until implementation is complete. Then continue to
the Finish section.

## Implementation with a Written Plan

If a plan is required, write the following self-contained artifacts. Set
`<run-id>` to `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<short-rand>`:

- `.agent-layer/tmp/write-plan.<run-id>.plan.md` - the implementation plan
- `.agent-layer/tmp/write-plan.<run-id>.task.md` - a checklist for all
  requirements, used to assess completion
- `.agent-layer/tmp/write-plan.<run-id>.context.md` - all background and context
  required for executing the implementation plan

If independent plan review is required, write each reviewer a self-contained
prompt instructing it to review the plan artifacts against `<input>` without
editing files or implementing. Dispatch all `plan_reviewers` concurrently. Then
update the artifacts to address any findings you agree with that are within
`<input>`'s scope. Do not repeat plan review.

Finally, dispatch `implementer` with a prompt instructing it to implement the
plan from the artifacts, run only targeted checks as needed, and return only
after completing the plan. The prompt must also instruct it not to invoke the
`implement` skill or dispatch another implementer.

Check completion against `<input>` and the plan artifacts. If the implementation
is incomplete, call `dispatch_continue` once with the `implementer` session
handle and a prompt listing the unmet requirements and instructing it to
complete the plan before returning. If implementation remains incomplete after
that continuation, use a fresh dispatch whose prompt includes the original
plan, current implementation state, and remaining work. Repeat the instruction
not to invoke the `implement` skill or dispatch another implementer in the
fresh prompt. If the continuation did not make meaningful progress, detail a
different approach in that prompt.

## Finish

1. Inspect and simplify the implementation without changing required behavior
   or broadening the task. Remove unnecessary complexity, duplication, dead
   code, premature abstractions, and tests that cannot detect a product defect.

2. If independent code review is required, dispatch `code_reviewer` to review
   the implementation against `<input>` and any plan artifacts without editing
   files. Evaluate each finding and fix those that are valid within `<input>`'s
   scope. Check findings related to explicit requirements against `<input>`
   before rejecting them. If the fixes are substantial, perform one fresh final
   review. Do not
   automatically repeat it.

3. Repeat the completion check against `<input>` and any plan artifacts. Resolve
   gaps until it passes. Passing tests are supporting evidence, not proof of
   completion.

4. Run the repository's complete required verification suite against the final
   candidate. Fix any failures, then run the minimal checks required to confirm
   the fixes.
