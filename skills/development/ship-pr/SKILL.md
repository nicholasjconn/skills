# ship-pr

Prerequisites: Requires dispatch-agent, a named pr_worker target, the Agent Dispatch MCP dispatch_start/inspect/wait/output/continue/cancel contract, Git, authenticated GitHub CLI (gh), Bash, jq, and standard OS tools. Its in-tree scripts are self-contained; Python 3.11+ is required only for their tests. Missing dispatch capabilities must be reported; tracked skill content can advance independently of the installed CLI.

Invoking this skill authorizes branch creation, staging, commits, pushes, PR
creation or updates, and eligible comment replies needed to prepare one PR for
merge. It does not authorize the merge itself.

If `references/repo-specific-pr-policy.md` exists, read it before starting the
workflow and treat it as authoritative.

## Inputs

Require a `pr_worker` dispatch target and use `/dispatch-agent` for every
dispatch. Relay any additional caller input in every `pr_worker` prompt.

Unless the user narrows the scope, include the entire current working tree.

## Workflow

1. Create a branch when repository norms require one. Commit the intended
   changes, push, and create or reuse the PR. Derive its title from the changes
   and fill `assets/pr-body-template.md`, removing unused sections and
   placeholders.

2. If the environment supports an output-triggered monitor, start one watcher
   in a managed background session, retain its task/session ID, and attach the
   monitor to wake on its events. Keep it running while actively monitoring the
   PR; do not wait for this persistent watcher to exit. Before returning to the
   caller for authorization, a blocker, or any other handoff, stop it through
   its managed session and verify it has stopped. Antigravity print mode can
   withhold a saved final response while a managed background task is running.
   If monitoring resumes, restart with the same append-only log; refetch
   authoritative state first, including after a transient transport failure.
   Stop the watcher when the PR merges or the workflow ends.

   ```bash
   bash <skill_dir>/scripts/watch-pr-events.sh \
     --repo <owner/name> \
     --pr <pr-number> \
     --log-file .agent-layer/tmp/ship-pr-events-<pr-number>.jsonl \
     --interval-seconds 60 \
     --review-deadline-seconds 600
   ```

   Without an output-triggered monitor, proceed to step 3. Whenever step 4
   requires waiting, run the same command in the foreground with
   `--exit-on-change`, reusing the log and keeping only one watcher active.
   The log detects changes between invocations and suppresses duplicate
   deadline notifications; it never replaces fresh GitHub state. Keep JSON
   payloads file-backed to avoid process argument-size limits.

3. Fetch the current head, checks, and mergeability with `gh`. Read comments
   with this stateless command; never infer current state from the watcher log:

   ```bash
   bash <skill_dir>/scripts/read-pr-comments.sh \
     --repo <owner/name> \
     --pr <pr-number>
   ```

   Dispatch `pr_worker` for unresolved feedback with the exact PR, head, and
   `references/address-pr-comments.md`; for a failed required check, also
   provide its evidence and `references/fix-ci.md`. Delegate all merge-conflict
   resolution, including mechanical conflicts, to `pr_worker` with the exact
   PR, head, base branch, and available conflict evidence. Require resolved
   changes and verification results, or an explicit blocker. The worker edits
   the local tree but does not commit, push, or post replies.

   The PR is ready to merge only when:

   - The PR is mergeable at its latest head.
   - At least one agent or human reviewer has posted feedback as a formal review
     or comment.
   - Every required check and repository gate is green.
   - Every eligible request has a supported posted reply, including one
     embedded in an automated approval, review summary, or pre-merge checklist.
   - If the optional repository policy exists, every merge criterion it defines
     is met.

   Ten minutes after PR `createdAt` is a deadline, not a mandatory wait.
   Act on each wakeup and check the deadline against fresh state, including
   when resuming. If the deadline passes without agent or human reviewer
   feedback, stop and report that none was received. If ready, continue to
   step 5. Otherwise, address the full actionable round before committing.

4. Commit and push accepted fixes. Replace every worker proposal beginning
   `Fixed.` with `Fixed in <full commit SHA>.`, naming the pushed commit that
   contains that fix; preserve its explanation after the canonical prefix.
   Post each supported worker-proposed reply one at a time: reply natively to
   inline comments; for conversation comments or review summaries, post an
   issue comment linking the source. Posted disposition replies must begin
   exactly `Fixed in <full commit SHA>.`, `Deferred.`, or `Disagreed.`. Rerun
   the comment command and correct any missing, noncanonical, or unsupported
   reply. Return to step 3 until ready. If only checks or reviews are pending,
   wait for the next watcher event as described in step 2.

5. Rerun the comment command and reconcile a request ledger against its
   output. List each eligible request with its source link and request text,
   its disposition and evidence (fixing commit, disagreement evidence, or
   deferral tracker), and its posted reply link; requests with the same
   disposition may share a reply that supports each. If any eligible request
   lacks a supported posted reply, return to step 3 and name those requests to
   `pr_worker`. Then stop the watcher and verify it has stopped before
   returning the single-use merge authorization request for the exact PR and
   head with the ledger, any substantive findings, and readiness evidence.

6. After authorization, refetch the head, checks, mergeability, and comments.
   Confirm the local tree is complete and every eligible request in the fresh
   comments appears in the ledger with a supported posted reply. If anything
   changed, restart the watcher as described in step 2, return to step 3, and
   obtain new authorization for the resulting PR head; otherwise merge.

7. Confirm the checkout is clean, switch to the default branch, fast-forward it,
   and delete branches or worktrees created by this workflow. Preserve state and
   report any cleanup that is unsafe to perform.
