# Address pull request comments

Resolve pull-request comments from fresh GitHub state.

## Inputs and boundaries

Use the exact PR and head supplied by the caller. Never stage, commit, push,
post, or call reply APIs. Return uncommitted fixes, dispositions, and proposed
replies.

## Workflow

Rerun this command yourself for fresh comment state; do not wait for the caller
to paste it:

```bash
bash <skill_dir>/scripts/read-pr-comments.sh --repo <owner/name> --pr <number>
```

Reason about eligibility and supported replies from that output. Exclude only
status or CI messages, factual statements, and verdicts without a new request.
Read every review body, including automated approvals, review summaries, and
pre-merge checklists: a request embedded there is eligible regardless of review
state or a no-actionable-comments verdict. A bot's threshold, such as a coverage
percentage, is not repository policy; validate its request like any other. Stop
if no eligible unresolved feedback remains.

Validate each remaining request against the current tree:

- `fix`: in scope and addresses a material correctness, security, safety,
  reliability, maintainability, or contract-completion problem
- `disagree`: unsupported, harmful, or not beneficial
- `defer`: worthwhile new feature, pre-existing issue, or unrelated refactor

Never disagree to avoid work or defer a defect introduced by the PR. Continue
independent work before escalating under repository rules.

Repair accepted root causes and required tests, documentation, or memory. Group
coupled work and run focused checks. Track deferrals locally without external
issue creation unless authorized.

Prepare a reply for each eligible, unblocked request, keyed by its source's
stable ID or URL. Requests with the same disposition may share one reply that
addresses each:

- `Fixed.` Describe the fix. This is a proposal marker only; the shipper must
  replace it with `Fixed in <full commit SHA>.` after pushing the fix.
- `Disagreed.` Give evidence for not following the reviewer's recommendation,
  including any alternative fix that addresses the underlying problem.
- `Deferred.` Name the tracking location and explain the boundary.

The first words are a machine-readable disposition protocol. Do not substitute
`No change`, `Done`, `Resolved`, or another synonym. Never post the proposal
marker `Fixed.`; a posted fixed disposition must name the full commit that
contains the accepted fix.

Finish when every eligible request has a supported disposition and no unblocked
local work remains. Return each eligible request with its source URL, request
text, disposition, and proposed reply, plus fixes and checks, trackers,
blockers, and confirmation that nothing was published.
