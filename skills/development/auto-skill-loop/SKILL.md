# auto-skill-loop

Prerequisites: Requires dispatch-agent, implement, ship-pr, the Agent Dispatch MCP dispatch_start/inspect/wait/output/continue/cancel contract, and named operator, planner, plan_reviewers, implementer, code_reviewer, pr_worker, and rote_worker targets. Issue/backlog modes use docs/agent-layer project memory conventions. Missing dispatch capabilities must be reported; tracked skill content can advance independently of the installed CLI.

Continue across PRs until the user stops the loop or step 1 reaches its no-work
exit condition. A merged PR or a worker's final reply does not complete the loop.
Report iteration outcomes as progress updates without ending the turn or asking
whether to continue.

## Inputs

Required:

- a `mode` matching `references/modes/<mode>.md`
- `merge_authorization`: standing authorization to merge under the gate below
- `operator`, `planner`, one or more `plan_reviewers`, `implementer`, `code_reviewer`,
  `pr_worker`, and `rote_worker` dispatch targets

Optional:

- `loop_context`: additional context for the orchestrator only
- `planner_context`: additional context included only in step 1
- `ship_pr_context`: additional context included only in step 2
- `operator_context`: additional context included only in `operator` dispatches

Every input must be explicitly named in the skill invocation. Do not infer an
unnamed input from unstructured text or from another input.

## Rules

- Use `/dispatch-agent` for every dispatch.
- Act as the orchestrator. Delegate all work.
- Build each dispatch prompt only from its specified prompt template.
- When compacting, retain the original user inputs and this skill verbatim in
  addition to what you would normally retain.

## Acting on the User's Behalf

This loop must run without human intervention. Each iteration is intended to result
in a merged PR. For each loop that requires human input, dispatch `operator` in
a fresh session. Use `dispatch_continue` for multiple invocations within a
single loop. The first prompt should include the complete contents of
`references/human-guidance.md`, followed by `operator_context` if provided, then
the item requiring human input with all provided details verbatim.

If the `operator` determines that real human intervention is required, save the
work to an appropriate remote branch for future handling, then check out the
primary branch. Continue with another loop iteration. Do not block the loop
waiting for human input.

## Loop

1. Dispatch `planner` with skill `implement`. Use the following as its prompt:

```text
<complete contents of references/modes/<mode>.md>
<planner_context, if provided>

implementer: <implementer>
plan_reviewers: <plan_reviewers>
code_reviewer: <code_reviewer>

Return a self-contained `<implementation_input>` that states the actual task,
request, or spec you implemented and includes paths to plan artifacts if used.
This context will preserve the intended scope during later review.
```

If `planner` is unable to find work to complete, repeat the dispatch one more
time. If two invocations in a row cannot find work, exit and inform the user.

2. Dispatch `rote_worker` with skill `ship-pr` and this prompt:

```text
pr_worker: <pr_worker>
<ship_pr_context, if provided>

Use the following context to preserve intended scope and behavior throughout the PR
workflow:

<implementation_input>
```

Continue when it returns a merge-authorization request.

3. Dispatch `operator` in a new session. Use the complete contents of
`references/merge-authorization.md` as its prompt, then append:

```text
<operator_context, if provided>
request: <rote_worker merge-authorization request>
```

4. If authorized, continue the dispatch session from step 2 with the exact
authorization. If not, continue the dispatch to preserve the PR and return to
the primary branch without merging.

5. Wait for the step 4 dispatch to finish merging and cleanup or preserving the
PR and returning to the primary branch. After either outcome, immediately return
to step 1 in the same run.
